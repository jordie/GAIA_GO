# Milestone Planning Output

This directory contains automated milestone plans generated by the Milestone Planning Worker.

## Overview

The milestone worker scans active projects and generates development milestone plans by:
- Analyzing TODO files, plan files, and code comments
- Extracting and classifying work items by priority, complexity, and category
- Organizing tasks into logical milestone phases
- Estimating effort and timelines
- Outputting structured JSON and human-readable markdown reports

## File Structure

```

├── README.md                                    # This file
├── {project}_milestones_{timestamp}.json       # Full milestone data (JSON)
├── {project}_summary.md                        # Human-readable summary
└── ...                                         # Historical milestone files
```

## Generated Files

### JSON Output Files
**Format**: `{project}_milestones_{timestamp}.json`

Contains complete milestone data including:
- Project metadata and generation timestamp
- All discovered tasks with full details
- Milestone definitions with task assignments
- Task categorization statistics

**Example**: `architect_milestones_20251225_013140.json`

### Summary Reports
**Format**: `{project}_summary.md`

Human-readable markdown reports with:
- Summary statistics (total tasks, milestones, hours, duration)
- Task breakdown by category and priority
- Detailed milestone descriptions
- Task lists for each milestone

**Example**: `architect_summary.md`

## Milestone Phases

Milestones are organized into development phases:

### Planning
- Documentation and specification
- Project setup and initialization
- High-priority configuration tasks
- Typical duration: 3-7 days

### Development
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Code enhancements
- Chunked into manageable groups of 10 tasks
- Typical duration: 7-20 days per phase

### Testing
- Test suite creation
- QA and verification tasks
- Test infrastructure setup
- Typical duration: 5-7 days

### Deployment
- Release preparation
- Deployment scripts
- Production configuration
- Typical duration: 3-5 days

## Task Classification

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical** - Urgent, blocking issues (keywords: critical, urgent, blocking, asap)
2. **High** - Important fixes and bugs (keywords: important, fix, bug, error)
3. **Medium** - Standard development tasks (default)
4. **Low** - Nice-to-have features (keywords: nice to have, wish, future)
5. **Very Low** - Optional enhancements (keywords: maybe, optional)

### Complexity Estimates
- **Simple** (1 hour) - Add, update, fix typo, rename, document
- **Medium** (4 hours) - Standard implementation, moderate changes
- **Complex** (16 hours) - Architecture, refactor, migration, framework, integration

### Categories
- **Feature** - New functionality, enhancements
- **Bug** - Bug fixes, error corrections
- **Test** - Testing and verification
- **Deployment** - Deployment and release tasks
- **Documentation** - Documentation and guides

## Usage Examples

### View Latest Summary
```bash
# Find latest summary for a project
ls -lt *_summary.md | head -1
cat architect_summary.md
```

### Parse JSON Data
```python
import json

# Load milestone data
with open('architect_milestones_20251225_013140.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

print(f"Project: {data['project']}")
print(f"Total Tasks: {data['total_tasks']}")
print(f"Milestones: {data['total_milestones']}")

# Iterate through milestones
for milestone in data['milestones']:
    print(f"\n{milestone['name']}")
    print(f"  Phase: {milestone['phase']}")
    print(f"  Tasks: {len(milestone['tasks'])}")
    print(f"  Hours: {milestone['total_hours']}")
```

### Filter Tasks
```python
import json

with open('architect_milestones_20251225_013140.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Get all milestones
milestones = data['milestones']

# Find high-priority tasks
for milestone in milestones:
    high_priority = [t for t in milestone['tasks'] if t['priority'] <= 2]
    if high_priority:
        print(f"\n{milestone['name']}: {len(high_priority)} high-priority tasks")

# Find complex tasks
for milestone in milestones:
    complex_tasks = [t for t in milestone['tasks'] if t['complexity'] == 'complex']
    if complex_tasks:
        print(f"\n{milestone['name']}: {len(complex_tasks)} complex tasks")
```

## Maintenance

### File Retention
Milestone files are retained indefinitely but can be cleaned up:

```bash
# Remove files older than 30 days
../scripts/milestone_planner.sh clean

# Manual cleanup
find . -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -delete
find . -name "*.md" -mtime +30 ! -name "README.md" -delete
```

### Re-scan Projects
```bash
# Scan all projects
../scripts/milestone_planner.sh scan

# Scan specific project
../scripts/milestone_planner.sh scan architect
```

## Statistics

## Integration

These milestone plans integrate with the Architect dashboard:
- View milestones in the dashboard UI
- Track progress against milestone targets
- Link tasks to tmux sessions
- Monitor completion status
