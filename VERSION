v0.1.0-phase9 (2026-02-25)

## Version Scheme
- Format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-phase#
- Phases: phase1 through phase9 (with subversion numbers for patches)
- Example: v0.1.0-phase9 = Phase 9, version 1, patch 0

## Stable vs Development
- Stable releases tagged as: v#.#.#-phase#
- Development branch: feature/phase9-consolidation-* (active work)
- Stable branch: stable-phase# (stable releases for production)

## Current Components (Phase 9 - Stable)
✓ Teacher Dashboard Handlers - HTTP route handlers for usability metrics
✓ Frustration Detection Engine - Real-time frustration analysis
✓ Real-time Metrics Aggregator - Time-windowed metric collection
✓ Usability Metrics Service - Background metrics persistence
✓ TeacherDashboardAlertRepository - Alert storage and retrieval
✓ PostgreSQL Integration - GORM-based persistence
✓ Graceful Shutdown - Signal handling and cleanup
✓ Health Check Endpoints - System status monitoring

## How to Use Stable Releases

### Using the Latest Stable Release
```bash
git checkout stable-phase9
./bin/server  # Run the pre-built binary
```

### Building from Stable Source
```bash
git checkout v0.1.0-phase9
go build -o ./bin/server ./cmd/server
```

### Staying on Stable with Feature Branches
```bash
# Create feature from stable, not from development
git checkout stable-phase9
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

## Release Notes for v0.1.0-phase9

### New Features
- Teacher Dashboard with real-time usability monitoring
- Frustration detection using multiple signals (errors, backspace, hesitation)
- Per-classroom and per-student metrics aggregation
- Health score calculation (0-100 scale)
- Struggling students identification
- Intervention recording and tracking
- Event-driven metrics pipeline

### Technical Improvements
- Replaced in-memory metrics with persistent PostgreSQL storage
- Implemented proper repository pattern for data access
- Added Chi router for HTTP routing (replaced Gin)
- Clean separation of concerns: handlers, services, repositories
- Proper dependency injection and initialization
- Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Raft package API incompatibilities
- Resolved unused variable warnings
- Removed deprecated configuration options

### Breaking Changes
None - this is the initial phase 9 release

### Migration Guide
No migration needed for new installations. Existing systems should:
1. Backup PostgreSQL database
2. Checkout stable-phase9 branch
3. Build and test in staging first
4. Deploy with gradual rollout

### Known Limitations
- SessionCoordinator and TaskQueue integration not yet complete
- Distributed consensus (Raft) support incomplete
- Session affinity scoring is placeholder implementation

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 9 (Current - Stable)
- ✓ Teacher usability monitoring
- ✓ Frustration detection
- ✓ Real-time metrics aggregation

### Phase 10 (In Progress)
- [ ] Auto-confirm patterns with AI agent fallback
- [ ] Support for rando inspector foundation
- [ ] Basic_edu integration
- [ ] Distributed session coordination
- [ ] Task queue management

### Future Phases
- Session affinity and load balancing
- Advanced ML-based frustration prediction
- Cross-classroom analytics
- Teacher intervention recommendations

## Support and Issues

For issues on the stable release:
1. Use the bug report template
2. Include version: `git describe --tags --always`
3. Provide logs from: `$GAIA_GO_HOME/logs/`
4. Do NOT report issues from development branches

For new features or development questions:
- Use feature branches from feature/phase9-consolidation-*
- Follow the multi-session work SOP in CLAUDE.md
- Discuss significant changes before implementation

## Release Checklist
